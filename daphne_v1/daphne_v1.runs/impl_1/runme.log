WARNING: [DRC REQP-1580] Phase alignment: Unsupported clocking topology used for ISERDESE2 AFE0_CH_0/DATA_COM/DATA_ISER/ISERDESE2_M_inst. This can result in corrupted data. The AFE0_CH_0/DATA_COM/DATA_ISER/ISERDESE2_M_inst/CLK / AFE0_CH_0/DATA_COM/DATA_ISER/ISERDESE2_M_inst/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship.
